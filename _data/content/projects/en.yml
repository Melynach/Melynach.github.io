        # Introduction
       {:data-align="center"}
        Data manipulation and preprocessing is a crucial step in any data analysis,
        especially when working with a real-life dataset that usually has inconsistent formatting, human errors and can also be incomplete.
        In fact, this step often represents almost half of the analyst's work. 
        In this article we are going to tackle the analysis of the PhD theses defended in France.

        First, we will start out the process by data cleaning and preprocessing to make our dataset more efficient, then,
        spotting outliers and finally analyzing trends over time and drawing insights about PhD theses in France.
        The data used in this analysis is a real-life dataset, from the French website theses.fr launched in 2011.
        It consists of 447643 rows and 18 columns and it contains information about thesis defended or in progress of defending in France,
        such as name and the id of the author, the name of the field, the date of defense, the date of first registration in doctorate,
        the name and the id of the mentor etc.

         We started our process by inspecting the missing values in our dataset.
         First, we made Table 01 that contains every variable in the dataset with its missing values percentage,
         and then we made a sorted matrix and heatmap to visualize the missing data in our variables.

        ### Paragraphs

        #### Paragraph

        **William Shakespeare**, Let me not to the marriage of true minds
        Admit impediments. Love is not love
        Which alters when it alteration finds,
        Or bends with the remover to remove.
        O no, it is an ever-fixed mark
        That looks on tempests and is never shaken;
        It is the star to every wand'ring barque,
        Whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken.
        Love's not Time's fool, though rosy lips and cheeks
        Within his bending sickle's compass come;
        Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks,
        But bears it out even to the edge of doom.
        If this be error and upon me proved,
        I never writ, nor no man ever loved.

        #### Texts

        Quoted text `Hello world`

        Bold text **Hello world**

        #### Blockquote

        > **William Shakespeare**, Let me not to the marriage of true minds

        That looks on tempests and is never shaken;
